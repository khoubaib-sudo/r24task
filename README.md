# Shopify Developer Test Task

## Description:
This repository contains the updated files related to the Rueckwand24 Shopify Developer task. The task was to implement a product showcase slider, including custom styling and functionality.

## Files Changed:
- `layout/theme.liquid`: Added SwiperJS CSS and JavaScript links in the header.
- `sections/main-product.liquid`: Added the custom slider code and logic to fetch product data, handle product links, and display product information in a carousel.

## Task Overview:
- Integrated a custom product showcase slider using SwiperJS.
- Added SwiperJS CDN links for CSS and JavaScript in `theme.liquid`.
- Ensured product images are clickable and redirect to the correct product URLs.
- Customized the pagination and navigation controls to match the design.
- Added a gradient overlay and captions for product titles and subtitles.

## Time Estimate:
The task took approximately 8 hours to complete, including development, testing, and styling adjustments.

## Feedback:
The task was a good challenge and gave me the opportunity to work with Liquid, JavaScript, and SwiperJS integration in Shopify. The biggest challenge was ensuring product URLs were correctly linked, but overall the process was smooth.
